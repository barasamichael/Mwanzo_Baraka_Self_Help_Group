# Mwanzo Baraka Self Help Group
*A management system based on `KCSE 2017 Computer Studies PP3`*

## Description
This project is a self-help group that aims to improve the economic status of its members through pooling of financial resources. Members can benefit by getting cheap loans from the organization, and membership to the organization is by registration.

## Membership
There are two types of membership for this organization: `individual` and `group`. An individual member pays a `registration fee` of Kshs. 2,000, while a group pays Kshs. 5,000. During the `registration of individuals`, personal details are captured. When registering a group, details of the group and those of its individual members are captured.

## Operation
An `individual member` contributes a `monthly share` of not less than Kshs. 1,000 to the organization. For those registered under a group, each member contributes a monthly share of not less than Kshs. 1,000, where Kshs. 200 is the group share contribution by the member. All `monthly contributions` are treated as shares for the contributor and attract annual dividends.

Members can `borrow loans` from the organization based on their `total shares`. Members registered as individuals can be loaned up to three times their share contribution, while members registered under a group can be loaned up to four times their individual share contribution. The repayment period does not exceed three years, and the loan attracts interest at a rate of 1.2% per month on the principal amount borrowed. A group can also get a `group loan`, amounting to three times the groupâ€™s total share contribution, which attracts interest at a rate of 0.8% per month payable within five years.

__All payments to the organization are monthly__ and must be made by the last day of the month. Any `defaulted payments` are penalized at a rate of 10% per month.

Every end of the year, the organization determines the total interest charged on all loans and `total penalties` on `defaulted amounts`. 60% of this amount is paid as dividends to the shareholders, each getting an amount proportional to their total share contributions. The balance is retained to run the organization.

## Objectives
The objectives of this organization are:

1. To provide a savings avenue to members and advance loans to them at an affordable rate of interest.
2. To represent, promote and advance all member interests.
3. To promote education among members.
4. To seek support from and work cooperatively with organizations, agencies, groups, individuals, and other stakeholders having aims and objectives compatible with the objectives of the organization.
